-- COMPUTED PROPERTIES --

If we use normal methods,
when we call the function addToA(), the addToB() is also called!

Because every time the value changes, 
VueJS looked at the functions and run them all.

In this situation, we only need to call the function that has value changed, 
we use the COMPUTED PROPERTIES! (automatically called)
